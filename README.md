# "Better Magento code through a disciplined approach" sample code

This repository holds sample code for this article on improving code posted on the Byte blog.

This is in now way production ready code, it might nog even make sense since it's an example to point out some refactoring options.

For questions, suggestions, etc go ahead and open up an issue in this repo and I'll respond as soon as I can.

## How to read this repo
`snippet.php` is the original code, all in one file.

`snippet_refactored.php` and all the code in `src/` is a refactoring of this code to split it up in single concerns.

## Install
Clone the repo and run either `composer install` or `composer dump-autoload` to generate a namespace map.
